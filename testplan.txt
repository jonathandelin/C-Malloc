Workload D will malloc() an amount of bytes that goes above the limit (ex. malloc(5000)) and then
use malloc to allocate 5000 bytes 120 times.

This will rigorously check if malloc() handles cases in which the user will try to allocate more memory than we can handle.

Workload E will malloc() 120 byte chunks and then free() all 120 of those valid pointers and it will also 
free() invalid pointers each 120 times. 

This will rigorously check if free() can distinguish between pointers that were malloc()ed and not malloc()ed.
